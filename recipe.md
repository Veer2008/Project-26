Make the dough

1. The first step to making a great pizza is to make a great pizza dough. In a large mixing bowl or in the bowl of a standing mixer with a hook attachment, add 1 teaspoon of instant yeast (3 grams) and ½ teaspoon of sugar. Instant yeast is rapid rising yeast.

If using dry active yeast or fresh yeast, then check the “Notes“ section of the recipe card below or follow these instructions:

1 teaspoon instant yeast = 1.5 teaspoons active dry yeast = 3 teaspoons fresh yeast
Mix dry active yeast or fresh yeast and ½ teaspoon sugar in 1 cup lukewarm water. Set aside for 10 to 15 minutes or until the mixture has become frothy and bubbly
Mix with rest of the ingredients and knead to a soft dough.
Add 1 cup of water and mix well.
Next add 3 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 teaspoon of salt.
Add 3 tablespoons of olive oil, or preferred flavorless oil.
Plus add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.

TIP: A little bit of acidity helps in gluten development. If you do not have lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar is an option.
Use the hook attachment of the standing mixture on medium speed to combine the ingredients and bring the dough together.

You can also knead the pizza dough by hand. To do so just be sure to fully knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes on a lightly floured surface.
The dough should be smooth, pliable and soft. If the dough looks dry, then you can add some water while kneading. If the dough seems sticky, sprinkle a bit of flour over the dough and continue to knead.
Once combined, shape into a round ball within the bowl. Use your fingers to spread a light layer of water all over the dough.
Cover the bowl with a lid or a kitchen towel, and allow to rise until the dough increases in volume and doubles up. This should take about 45 minutes to 1.5 hours, depending on the temperature of your kitchen.

If using dry active yeast, then keep covered for 1:30 hours to 3 hours (it depends on the temperature conditions in your city).
Knead the dough lightly again, and either use immediately or pack and store in the fridge or freezer.

Assembling Margherita Pizza

 To make pizza with your homemade dough, first prepare a 9-inch pan or tray by lightly greasing with oil and dusting with flour, cornmeal, or semolina.
 Preheat the oven to its highest possible temperature. My oven has 250 degrees Celsius (475 degrees Fahrenheit) as the highest temperature.

Allow the oven to preheat for 15 to 20 minutes before baking the pizza to make sure it’s perfectly hot.
Separate the pizza dough into 6 or 7 even sections, packaging and storing any you’re not planning to use. To store, wrap each individual section in plastic wrap, and then seal all of the dough in an airtight plastic bag or other container.
Working one pizza crust at a time, lightly flour a clean surface and sprinkle the dough with flour.
Use a rolling pin to roll the dough ball into a flat circle, about 0.5 centimeter or ¼ inch thick. Flour the rolling pin if it sticks, or use a piece of parchment paper between the dough and rolling pin.


Carefully lift and place the dough into the greased baking or tray.
Next, spread on a thin layer of store bought or homemade pizza sauce. Leave a good bit of room around the edge of the dough clear for the crust.
Add a generous sprinkling of vegetarian parmesan cheese (optional).
And top with lots of fresh mozzarella cheese. Spread out evenly, again, avoiding the very edge of the crust. Break fresh mozzarella cheese into chunks and place it on the crust.

TIP: If you have water soaked fresh mozzarella, then squeeze water from the mozzarella to avoid a soggy crust.

Baking

 Move the baking rack or tray to the lowest position in your preheated oven. This will help create a wonderfully crispy crust.

Place the pizza pan either on the rack or on the tray.
Bake the Margherita pizza for 10 to 15 minutes, until the cheese is completely melted and the crust is lightly golden in color.
Serving Suggestions

Serving Suggestions

 Remove from the oven and top the pizza with some torn fresh basil leaves. You can also add a dash of dried oregano or red chili flakes, if you want.

I also recommend that you drizzle a bit of extra virgin olive on the Margherita pizza just before serving, for a truly authentic Italian taste.

TIP: Fresh basil is always added on a baked pizza. Do not add fresh basil before baking the pizza as it will wilt, dry out and loose its delicate aromatic flavor.
Use a pizza cutter or serrated knife to cut the Margherita pizza into 4 to 6 even slices.

Buon appetito!
